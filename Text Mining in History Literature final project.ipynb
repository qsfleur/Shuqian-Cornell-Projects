    "# Final project\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to: identify an interesting problem that's addressable with the help of computational methods applied to the supplied corpus, formulate a hypothesis about that problem, devise an experiment or experiments to test your hypothesis, present the results of your investigations, and discuss your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow essentially replicates the process of writing an academic paper. You can think of your exam as a paper in miniature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to present each of these tasks as you see fit. You should use narrative text (that is, your own writing in a markdown cell), citations of others' work, numerical results, tables of data, and static and/or interactive visualizations as appropriate. Total length is flexible and depends on the number of people involved in the work, as well as the specific balance you strike between the ambition of your question and the sophistication of your methods. But be aware that numbers never, ever speak for themselves. Quantitative results presented without substantial discussion will not earn high marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should reflect, at minimum, ten **or more** hours of work, though you will be graded on the quality of your output, not the amount of time it took you to produce it. Most high-quality projects represent twenty or more hours of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pick an important and interesting problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "No amount of technical sophistication will overcome a fundamentally uninteresting problem at the core of your work. You have seen many pieces of successful computational humanities research over the course of the semester. You might use these as a guide to the kinds of problems that interest scholars in a range of humanities disciplines. You may also want to spend some time in the library, reading recent books and articles in the professional literature. **Problem selection and motivation are integral parts of the project.** Do not neglect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "We have supplied you (via the course GitHub site) with a corpus of 1,540 volumes of American fiction published between 1789 and 1875, as well as a range of potentially relevant metadata. This corpus is large: it contains well over 100 million words. Some summary and descriptive statistics are included below, along with a short annotation of the metadata fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be aware that some (but certainly not all) text analysis tasks will be slow (or impossible) when run over a corpus as large as this one.** For comparison purposes, the subsampled album review dataset we used for homework 8 contained about 1% as many words (but a similar number of total documents). You might consider whether or not your question requires the use of the full corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Books in the corpus are those that were included in volumes 1 and 2 of Lyle Wright's three-volume bibliography of American fiction before 1900 and that were digitized by the University of Virginia (1789-1850) and Indiana University (1851-1875). This corpus includes about 40% of the American fiction from the period (1789-1875) that has been preserved in American academic libraries. You might think a little about what kinds of books are most likely to have found their way first into print and then into academic libraries, and what kinds of books (and authors) might not have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata were collected manually by a team of undergraduate students at the University of Notre Dame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the nineteenth century was awful.** These books reflect that fact in all kinds of ways, even though (or maybe because) they were generally considered unproblematic at the time. If you read the books or dig very far into the most informative features, you will quickly discover objectionable content. It would be valuable to devise (and you will be rewarded for devising) methods to avoid displaying unmasked versions of racial slurs, for example, in any visualization that might otherwise include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your exam as a report in the form of a Jupyter notebook that includes all code, figures, and write-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should have four basic sections (provided in cells below for ease of reference and reuse):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction and hypothesis.** What problem are you working on? Why is it interesting and important? What have other people said about it? What do you expect to find?\n",
    "2. **Corpus, data, and methods.** What data have you used? What are the limitations of that data? What major methods will you use to analyze it? Why are those methods the appropriate ones?\n",
    "3. **Results.** What did you find? How did you find it? How should we read your figures? Be sure to include confidence intervals or other measures of statistical significance or uncetainty where appropriate.\n",
    "4. **Discussion and conclusions.** What does it all mean? Do your results support your hypothesis? Why or why not? What are the limitations of your study and how might those limitations be addressed in future work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each of those sections, you may use as many code and markdown cells as you like. You may, of course, address additional questions or issues not listed above. You may also gather additional data or metadata relevant to your analysis, but you are not required to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code used in the project should be present in the notebook (except for widely-available libraries that you import), but **be sure that we can read and understand your report in full without rerunning the code**. Unexecuted code will receive no credit. Be sure, too, to explain what you're doing along the way, both by describing your data and methods and by writing clean, well commented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam is the take-home final for the course. It is worth 35% of your overall grade. You will be graded on the quality and ambition of each aspect of the project. No single component is more important than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical details\n",
    "\n",
    "* The exam is due at **noon on Saturday, December 9** via upload of a single, fully executed Jupyter notebook file to CMS.\n",
    "* **You must work alone.** You may not collaborate with others.\n",
    "    * You may post questions on Ed, but should do so privately (visible to course staff only).\n",
    "* Interactive visualizations do not always work when embedded in shared notebooks. If you plan to use interactives, you may need to host them elsewhere and link to them.\n",
    "\n",

    "I will work on <b>the relationship between the authors' occupations and their writing</b>, specifically, <b>how authors whose primary occupation as Church, Politics-Government-Activism and Law could potentially relate</b>. This is an interesting question because, between 1789 and 1875, the founding years of the United States, the churches played a central role in American lives and the church figures had a significant presence across the country. They provided spiritual guidance and shaped religious beliefs for people and communities. They played a central role in influencing social norms and values and advocating for politically-related things such as abolitionism. The legal frameworks are also influenced by church and religious beliefs. The close relationship between Politics-Government-Activism and Law is explicit, as these two things are inherently relevant. I am interested in whether texts written by people working in the field of Politics-Government-Activism and Law reflect the religious influence, and whether writers from church backgrounds write about Politics-Government-Activism and Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions I will ask throughout the project are: Are writers' occupations and real-world experience reflected in their writing? Do writers with occupations in church address issues in Politics-Government-Activism and Law within their written works, and do authors in Politics-Government-Activism and Law have religious impacts in their writing? How do we distinguish texts written by authors in Politics-Government-Activism and Law? What are the top word choices they use that indicate the mutual influence? Could we predict the author's occupation (Politics-Government-Activism, Law, or Church) based on their writing? The ultimate goal of this project is to train a model to predict the writer's occupation based on the writing using LLM-based model, and maximum accuracy is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I expect to find that writers who share similar occupations and prefer writing similar topics and use similar words. I also expect to find high accuracies to predict the author's occupation through their pieces of writing. If successful, this project could have a meaningful extension to the modern world in exploring writing preference similarities between authors who have occupations in similar areas and different occupations are closely interrelated that are reflected in their writing.\n"

    "* `occupation` and `occupation_free`: The author's primary employment identification. Recall that the US in the nineteenth century didn't always have a large market for novels, so many of the authors in the corpus made their living by other means. The difference between these fields is that `occupation` uses a fixed vocabulary, while `occupation_free` does not (so includes more detailed or fine-grained information).\n",

    "Based on the results from fightinwords, we see that the authors who work in Church indeed refer a lot to religious elements, such as god, lord, and church. For authors in Law, they write a lot about colonel, captain, etc. For authors in Politics-Government-Activism, they write a lot about people, as names such as laura and dick and nouns like mother and wife are frequent words, and places, such as paris. Religious words such as \"lord\" do appear in both Law and Politics-Government-Activism texts, but it is difficult to determine whether these words are used in a religious context, since they can mean different things under various contexts. Both authors from Law and Politics-Government-Activism have an inclination to write about \"eyes\", \"colonel\", etc. I am interested in whether authors from these two fields might have similar preferences in what they write. From this step forward, I will employ a BERT model to predict whether texts could be correctly predicted to be written by authors from Law or Politics-Government-Activism based on the words. I will process the occupation labels into binary values: 0 for Law and 1 for Politics-Government-Activism."

Among the three classifiers, GaussianNB had cross validated f1-score 0.49, svm had cross validated f1-score 0.58, and MLPClassifier had cross validated f1-score 0.54. Although it seems that GaussianNB performed the worst, the fact that its f1-score for class 0 is not 0 is what I wanted. Also, GaussianNB works well with smaller datasets, so I decided to use GaussianNB as my baseline classifier."

    "The average f1 accuracy of the prediction after using the BERT model is 0.69, which is higher than 0.59, the baseline performance, but not significantly. For this problem, since I examine the difference between Law and Politics-Government-Activism authors' writing preferences, I consider both class 0 - Law - and class 1 - Politics-Government-Activism - the same and do not consider the score of one class more important than the other. However, the difference between data sizes might affect the output, as discussed earlier, the size for Politics-Government-Activism is almost 2 times bigger than Law, which could lead to biase when training the model as the model would be more inclined to predict Politics-Government-Activism, which is greater in number. The small data size also might be the cause."

However, it is also important to take into account that the process data entails all texts from authors with the same occupation, which means even if some authors with Church occupation don't write about Church at "

It's first important to acknowledge that what authors like to write solely depend on their personal preferences and might not have any connections with their occupation. The context of these texts might also affect the performance of the BERT model, as texts from earlier periods might have different word choices and meanings that differ from those BERT is trained on."

The texts written by authors with occupations in Politics-Government-Activism and Law seem to connect for their similar word choices, but the religious influences are not extremely explicit.\n",
